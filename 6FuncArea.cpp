//6.Write a program to print the area of a rectangle by creating a class named 'Area'
//having two functions.
//First function named as 'setDim' takes the length and breadth of the rectangle as parameters
//and the second function named as 'getArea' returns the area of the rectangle.
//Length and breadth of the rectangle are entered through keyboard.
